# Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. 
# The default fare charge for any vehicle is its seating capacity multiplied by 100 (seating capacity * 100).
# If the vehicle is a Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% to the full fare as a maintenance charge. 
# Therefore, the total fare for a Bus instance will be the final amount, 
# calculated as total fare plus 10% of the total fare. (final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.)
# Note: The bus seating capacity is 50, so the final fare amount should be 5500.

# class Vehicle:
#     def __init__(self, name, mileage, capacity):
#         self.name = name
#         self.mileage = mileage
#         self.capacity = capacity

#     def fare(self):
#         return self.capacity * 100

# class Bus(Vehicle):
#     pass

# School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 12, 50)
# print("Total Bus fare is:", School_bus.fare())
